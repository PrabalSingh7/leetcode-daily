Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
Example 2:

Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
 

Constraints:

0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

Intuition
Basic Mathematical Function.

Approach
result = (high-low) / 2
if either of low or high is odd , then result += 1
Complexity
Time complexity : O(1)
Space complexity : O(1)
Code
class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        int res = (high - low)/2;
        if( (low%2!=0) || (high%2!=0))  res++;
        return res;
    }
};
